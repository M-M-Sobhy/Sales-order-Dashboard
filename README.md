# Sales-order-Dashboard
In this project I used Tableau to build an interactive dashboard analyzing customer orders. It tracks KPIs such as total orders, quantity, and final cost. The dashboard also explores order trends by date, category, product type, and geography, helping businesses monitor sales performance and identify growth opportunities.
